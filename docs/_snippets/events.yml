  ## Cancel a quest: `cancel`

  This event works in the same way as a [quest canceler in the backpack](Documentation/Features/Quest-Cancelers.md).

  Running this event is equal to the player canceling a quest using the backpack.
  The only argument is the identifier of a quest canceler, as defined in the `cancel` section.

  ```YAML title="Example"
  cancelQuest: "cancel woodQuest"
  ```
