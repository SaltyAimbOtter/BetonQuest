ProQuest, QuestWorld (2) and Quest by LMBishop have been classified as way to limited or unknown to appear in this table. They are simple task plugins,
not plugins that are able to create story driven quests.

[^1]: This table has been last updated on the 17th of January 2021. If there are any mistakes let us know!
[^2]: This means that Open Source plugins cannot add support which is considered an unfriendly policy.


## Beautiful multi-threaded Conversations
Players can have immersive conversation with NPC's by utilizing BetonQuests Multi-Path-Conversation System.
Questers can freely define multi-threaded stories, narrated with NPC conversations,
and with multiple endings that affect a player's gameplay.
Questers can also choose between five different styles to display their conversations.

## Endless Integrations

BetonQuest supports more then 25 other plugins, ranging from standard plugins like WorldGuard/WorldEdit and Citizens
to more advanced ones such as EffectLib.
It also offers support for other quest plugins, so you can just keep your old quests and create further additions to your quest
lines based upon the progress in your old plugin. If just Beton isn't enough you can always just hook into Skript or Denizen too.

See the full list of integrations [here](../Documentation/Compatibility.md).

## Custom Notification System

Questers can make use of BetonQuests notifyIO system that provides access to all of Minecafts GUI elements to display notifications.
Therefore you can provide information to your players like so:

BetonQuest makes it possible to provide NPC conversations in any language. Each player
can set his own language which means that - if translated - all conversations will be in the players native language.

You can give players information about where they are in a quest using the "Journal". The Journal is a book in which you can
write content based on the players actions.

## Player, NPC and Hologram Hider

BetonQuest allows you to hide Players from each other based on whatever conditions you define. The same works for NPC's
and HolographicDisplays Holograms.

## Training included

This website provides **in-depth learning material** for your staff which teaches them all BetonQuest basics.
It also has guides on related topics such as the setup of a local test server, so your main server will not get
flooded with bugs while your staff learns to write quests.
