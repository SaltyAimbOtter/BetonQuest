BetonQuest is an ^^advanced and powerful quest plugin^^.
It offers RPG-style conversations with NPCs and an extremly flexible quest system.

It's _**^^multi-path conversations^^**_ can be displayed in many ways ranging from basic clickable chat output, to all-new technologies.
BetonQuest is not limited to simple, repetitive quests but can also power highly flexible ones that have never been seen before.

This is made possible by _**support for more than 25 other plugins**_ such as
Citizens, MMOCore, MMOItems, MythicMobs, JobsReborn, Magic, McMMO, Denizen and Skript. You can also interact with other quest plugins
such as "Quests" to maintain compatibility with existing Quests on your server.
